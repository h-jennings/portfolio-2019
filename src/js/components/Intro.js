          <p>
          I&apos;m a multidisciplinary front-end developer with a formal background in marketing, based in Washington D.C. As a marketer, I worked with over 50 clients to help them connect with their digital audience.

          I love making designs come to life through teamwork and collaboration. I believe an organization&apos;s digital presence should mirror their spirit and push boundaries.
